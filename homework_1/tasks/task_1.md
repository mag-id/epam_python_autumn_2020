## Warming up

- [+] Please create your own git repository on github.
- [+] Setup pre-commit hook with `black` and `isort` formatting for the repo.
- [+] Initialize .gitignore in the repository root (you can use [this](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore) sample).
- [+] Create a `homework1` directory in the repo.
- [+] Then copy the `sample_project` into the directory.
- [+] Fix all bugs in the `sample_project` code.
- [+] Write an extra test for each found bug.

**Note**: as we said, any hw, which does not pass `isort --profile black --check` and `black --check`, will be rejected.

**Personal updates and improvements**
- [+] Pylint also was added.
- [+] `homework1` renamed to `homework_1`.
