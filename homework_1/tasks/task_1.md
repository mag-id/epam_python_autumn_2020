## Warming up

- [+] please create your own git repository on github.
- [ ] setup pre-commit hook with `black` and `isort` formatting for the repo
- [+] initialize .gitignore in the repository root (you can use [this](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore) sample)
- [+] create a `homework1` directory in the repo
- [+] then copy the `sample_project` into the directory.
- [ ] fix all bugs in the `sample_project` code
- [ ] write an extra test for each found bug

**Note**: as we said, any hw, which does not pass `isort --profile black --check` and `black --check`, will be rejected
